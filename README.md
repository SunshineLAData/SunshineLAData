### Hi there 👋
I am a data consultant at Kaiser Permenante with extensive experience in data exploration analysis, data visualization, and marketing campaign management.

🔭 I’m currently working on a Kaggle project about predicting house prices

🌱 I’m currently learning to build sophistcated models

⚡ Fun fact: I have negative sense of directions

💖 I like running and hiking
